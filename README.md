# DnD -  HTML character sheet #
A HTML based DnD Charcter Sheet to be used with a browser. Because PDF forms suck.

This is a DnD character sheet made in HTML to be directly run locally from the player's computer. The HTML form auto saves to local storage so that the data persists across multiple reloads/launches of the web browser. (Making a new charcter every time would defeat the purpose and would give PDF form believers a leg to stand on.)


**Spellcasting is currently under development - The attacks, actions and weapons section can be used for spellcasting, but it is significantly more cumbersome**

## Features ##
1. Consistent display of information. (Say goodbye to PDF forms not opening correctly on edge and then the saved form not opening correctly on chrome where it once opened just fine.)
2. Scrolling and textboxes that maintain sane sizes. (and font sizes)
3. Checkboxes that work like a charm every time.
4. Display those pesky numbers after the + in the skills and saving throws while not obscuring the label. (whaaat?)

## Upcoming Features (in order of development)
1. Spellcasting table - A full, dedicated spellcasting section to keep all your spells neatly at the end.
2. A DnDBeyond-esque die roller (but significantly less fancy, albeit functional).
3. Dark Mode (!! suck it PDF Sheets)
4. A page popup of sorts to dnd wikidot for quick refernces for levelups and such.

## Installation/ Setup ##
1. Download this repo.
2. Extract the .zip file to a directory of your choice.
3. Et voila!

## Usage ##
Simply right click on the character_sheet.html and click open with > (your favourite browser here)
